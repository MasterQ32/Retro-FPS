Compiling Retro-FPS

Here I'll try to tell you how to use this project for your needs..

Requirements
---------------

Well, compiling and running actuall version is pretty simple, you'll need :

	* Download free edition of GameStudio A8 from the official [download webpage](http://www.3dgamestudio.com/download.php). Note that with free edition you won't be able to use shaders.. That's because GameStudio supports shaders only starting from Commercial edition.
	* Some sound files.. As this project uses (as a placeholder) few sounds from ID Software sounds, you'll need to find your own ones.. Or.. simply copy main.wrs (from the bin.zip) into the root folder of your project!

Building/Running
---------------

	* In order to 'Run' the project, open 'main.c' (from the source folder) in SED (Script Editor) and hit F5.
	* In order to 'Build' the project into the .exe, you need to open 'main.c' (yep, it's in source folder) in SED, then go to File->Publish Main Script and hit OK. In the given folder, will be created 'main.cd' folder, containing your .exe file.

Optional
---------------

	* If you want to create your own level, try playing around with WED (world editor). But I have to warn you, building levels with it quite painful xD
